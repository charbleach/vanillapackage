# vanillapackage
A .vpk/.psvimg File Installer that works through SilicaAndPina/Yifanlu's psvimagetools-frontend by using and replacing EasyInstallers.

# What will you be able to install with this?
Essentially any extracted .VPK file or .psvimg file. To gain a mass amount of those files will however need a lot of file dumps.

# So I can install my 100% paid for Game BACKUPS?
Most likely. It depends on how the inital testing goes.

# What versions of PS Vita Firmware will it be able to run on?
My Vita is on 3.67, so it will run on 3.67 and possibly below that.

# I have my credit card right here, how much is it?
It will be free to test, and free to use always.

# wen ETA?
eta son or latter. 

# What still needs to be done?
The whole thing. I know how I'm going to do it, but I don't have the urge to do it ATM.

# wen ETA? wen ETA? wen ETA? wen ETA? wen ETA? wen ETA? wen ETA? wen ETA? why Block on Twitter?
Yeah, don't spam me with questions on Twitter like that, or you get blocked. If you want to follow me to see how it's going, I'm @charbleach.
