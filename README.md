VPK File Installer for Vitas without HENkaku.

# How will it work? (The Concept)
This application will work by signing a VPK of your choice (no pirating, please!) to your account (or spoofing it to 'appear' on the PS Store, who knows at this point) and installing it to your Vita. 

# How would you install it?
Through a program like psvimgtools.

# What is it useful for?
Installing apps like Adrenaline or Game BACKUPS(!) to your Vita without the need for HENkaku.

# wen eta?
Not anytime soon.
